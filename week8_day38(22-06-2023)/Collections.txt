Collections
For overcome the limitations of the arry it will be used.
1.Size will not be fixed.
2.it will store similar data types 
3.we will methods.

Group of objects of a single entity so we can go for the collections.

A collection is also a container that gropus of multiple  objects stored in a single unit 
Ex:List of emplyees,Shoping cart.


Collections frame work
It is frame work is a unified architecture for representimg and manipulating collections.
Iterable -it will iterate the collections.
collection-it is at the top of hierachy will collect all the interfaces like list,queue,set,map.


Methods
add(object o)
addAll(colectiono) all the objects in clooection will be added and it will return true
clear() it will remove all the elements in the object
contains()- check weather collection is there are not it will return boolean


List Interface
Ordering among the objects  and the allowing the duplicate elements
Methods of ListInterface
Implementation class are

1.ArrayList
Dynamic memeory incease and decrease at runtime
it contain duplicate implements and maintains insertion order.
methods are ensure capacity() and trimSize()
It index based and allow duplicate elements and follows insertion order and not synchronised and no thread safe

It is not suitable for if u want to perform frequent insertion and deletion
It is used for Frequent searching operations.



2.LinkedList
It provides a linked List datastructures
It extends Abstract
It is suitable for insertion and deletion in the middle of collections
