Differnces between the POP and OOP
1.In POP the concentrate will be on procesdue and functions and in OOP the concentrate will on class and objects.
2.if we want modify the code in POP we want to change the entire program and in OOP no need to change just create another class and objext
3.In OOPS,the object to object communication done through methods and in
4.In OOPS,data and methodsthat work on data will be combined into a single unit called class.


Object-oriented programming 

    •Object-oriented programming lets you extend a program without having to touch previously tested, working code
    Object-oriented programming provides great flexibility, modularity and reusability through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

​principles of  oops java
Inheritance         
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction

​1.Inheritance
    Deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes acquire all the features of existing classes is called inheritance
code reusesability and code size reduced.


2.Polymorphism
Ability to take more than one form
it is used in implementing the inheritance.
example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

3.Encapsulation.
the method and the method  work on data will be combines and that single unit is called as encapsulation and it will helps in secure the data and data hiding.
Example: a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

4.Abstraction
Hiding all the uncessary implementation details and only exposing only the required functionalities
Example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.




Object:
object is a real world entitity and physically exists r logically 
it has properties and atributes and it can do actions and identity.

1.Software to develop online book store:
Objects are book name ,type of book,racks,book colour ,name of author,
Actions are read the book ,take the book and we can search books and buy the books

objects-book 
Atribute-Book name ,author of the book,type of book
Actions-Add book ,change book,remove the book from site,identify the book exchange the bbok read and indrerstand the concept of the  book.


Object:Website for open page
Atribute -name of website ,login id,esername and password to open site 
Actions-change the useranme and password of the site and create new username .

Object-Order
Atribute-order Id ,name of person who order,type of book ordered,order address
Actions-change order,return order,siping  order,user take the  book return order,cancel order and exachange order.

Object-Cost
Atribute-cost Id ,price of the book,type of cost
Actions-Increase decrease the cost,take the trancation by paying the money.



2.To develop SOftware Employee management system.

object:-facebook
attributes:-name,login page,posts,read,write.
actions:-login,logout,chage password,add new user.

object:-likes and dislikes
attribute:-likes and dislikes,count of likes and  dislike.
actions:-add new like,dislike,remove like and dilike

objects are used to call the methods, The objects are created with new operator with the respective class name.

Methods
two types
1.pre defined 
2.user defined

variables
1.Instance variables
(i)It will be declared outside of  a method or constructor or block but within class for every objects values will be change and 
(ii)It will store default values when we dont give values
(iii)it will be created at the time of object creation and will destroyyed when object is destriyed .
it will be stored in Heap area
accessing Objectname.variable name

2.Static variables
(i)Does not change values object to object for saving memory
(ii)It will declared outside method and use static keyword and only one copy will be created and that will be shared all the objects of the class.
(iii)It will be created at the time of the loading of the class and they will be destroyed when the class is unloaded. 
it will be stored Method area or class area
accessing Objectname.variable name or classname .variable name

3.Local variables
1.Inside the method can be used local variables and used for temperory
2.when ur using have to initialize. 
3.it will be stored in stack area.

Types of methods
1.setter or mutator
setting the atributes from objects

2.Accessor or getter methods
getting the atributes from the objects

Method Overloading
changing the no of parameters and data types with out changing the reyturn type

constructor
If there are many creation of objects we need more values so by using this we will access the values in the object only for instance variables and it will not have return type.
constructor name must have same class name  only.
give the initial values for the instaance variables.
at the time creating object of the class it will be called.



 

Types of constructor
1.no argumented constructor
there are  no parameters in the constructor and it will get default paramaeters as a output

Ex:
class Student{
  String name; //instance variable
  int id; //instance variable
public Student(){
    
 }
public void talk(){
    System.out.println("name is"+name);
    System.out.println("id is"+id);
  }
public class Ex100{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Student s1= new Student();
   
    s1.talk();
 

2.parameterised constructor
the parameters will be given to tha constructor and it will get the values in object creation.

Example:
class Student{
  String name; //instance variable
  int id; //instance variable
 
  public Student(String n, int i){
    name=n;
    id=i;
  }
  
  public void talk(){
    System.out.println("name is"+name);
    System.out.println("id is"+id);
  }
  
}
 public class Ex100{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Student s1= new Student("pavan",1);
   
    s1.talk();
 
    Student s2= new Student("kumar",2);
   
    s2.talk();
  }
}

3.default constructor
if user dont give constructor then the  JvM  will take automatically by taking the defaulit parametters as a output.

Example:
class Student{
  String name; //instance variable
  int id; //instance variable
 public void talk(){
    System.out.println("name is"+name);
    System.out.println("id is"+id);
  }
public class Ex100{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Student s1= new Student();
    s1.talk()



Constructor Overloading
two r more different types of  constructor with same names are used then it is over loadred constructor

This method 
it is used to refer the current object and it removes ambuigity or relation  between them.

Static keyword
1.used for memory management and independent of the object we use static keyword
2.used with variable,method,block and nested classes.
3.it can access static data member and can change the value of it.
4.it belongs to the class rarther than the object of the class.
5.can not use not static data member or call non static method directly.
6.static method belongs to the class.It can be invoked without the need for 7.creating an instance of a class.They cannot use non static memebers.

static method:-static method access the static data and modifys it.
static block-static block execute before execution of first  static method


Keywords
class 
void 
if 
else 
for 
while 
do
switch
break
default
case
public
private
protected



//program to illustrate usage of this keyword in constructor overloading 
class Test
{
    Test() //no-arg constructor
    {
        this(10,20);
    System.out.println("I am from Default Constructor");
    }
    Test(int x) //parameterized constructor
    {
        this(); //call the no-arg constructor
        System.out.println("I am from Single Parameter Constructor");
    
    }
    Test(int x, int y) //parameterized constructor
    {
        System.out.println("I am from Double Parameter Constructor");
    }
}
class ThisConDemo
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Test t1 = new Test(10);
    }
}
 


//program to illustrate this keyword
//program to illustrate Passing this as an Argument
 
class ThisExample {
    // declare variables
    int x;
    int y;
 
    ThisExample(int x, int y) {
       // assign values of variables inside constructor
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
 
        // value of x and y before calling add()
        System.out.println("Before passing this to addTwo() method:");
        System.out.println("x = " + this.x + ", y = " + this.y);
 
        // call the add() method passing this as argument
        add(this);
 
        // value of x and y after calling add()
        System.out.println("After passing this to addTwo() method:");
        System.out.println("x = " + this.x + ", y = " + this.y);
    }
 
    void add(ThisExample o){
        o.x += 2;
        o.y += 2;
    }
}
 
class Test4 {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        ThisExample obj = new ThisExample(1, -2);
    }
}


* If there is is a relationship between the classes go for the inheritance.
​Types of inheritance
1.single inheritance -only parent class and child class
2.Multiple inheritance-two parent classes and one child class
3.multilevel inheritance-one grandparent ,parent and child
4.Hirachical inheritance-one parent and two children
5.Hybrid Inheritance-combination of all types




ØThe inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
ØWe can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
ØThe inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
ØWe can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it .
ØWe can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
ØWe can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super

super keyword
used to represent super class from sub class

three ways
1.refer the immediate parent class instance variables
2.invoke immediate parent class method.
3.super()
used to invoke the immediate parent class constructor.
it should be the first statement
from the sub class can call super class it should be the first statement by using super.
super class constructor cannot be caled in sub class methods 

if there are no arguments contructor  in super class super is optional
if there are parameterised constructed in super super is mandatory


whenever subclass object need to be created
1.first Jvm has to be loaded first super class bute code will br loaded to memory
2.then loaded sub class.

Create a class called "Account" that represents a bank account. The class should have properties such as account number, balance, and account holder name, and methods such as deposit, withdraw and check balance. Create another class called "ATMSimulator" that represents an ATM machine. The class should have a list of accounts, and methods such as addAccount, removeAccount, and transact.
