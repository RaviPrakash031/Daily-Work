write an algorithm to find the number of positive factors of an integer
step1:start
step2:Read the values of n
step3:Initialize count=0 and i=1
step4: Repeated the steps (i),(ii) and (iii)until (i<=n)
         (i)if(n%i==0)
         (ii)count=count+1
         (iii)i=i+1
step5:print(count)
step6:end
