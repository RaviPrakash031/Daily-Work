1.write an algorithm to find the sum of first n even numbers(2,4,6,8,.....)
step1:start
step2: read the positive integer n
step3:intialize sum=0 and i=2 and count =1
step4:repeated the steps (i) and (ii)
                  if (i count<=n)
        (i)sum=sum+i
        (ii)i=i+2 
        (iii)count=count+1
step5:print (sum)

step1:start
step2:Read the  odd values of n
step3:Initialize product=1 and i=1 count=1
step4: Repeated the steps (i) and (ii)until  (count<=n)
         (i)product=product*i
         (ii)i=i+2
         (iii)count=count+1
step5:print(product)
step6:end
