Differnces between the POP and OOP
1.In POP the concentrate will be on procesdue and functions and in OOP the concentrate will on class and objects.
2.if we want modify the code in POP we want to change the entire program and in OOP no need to change just create another class and objext
3.In OOPS,the object to object communication done through methods and in
4.In OOPS,data and methodsthat work on data will be combined into a single unit called class.


Object-oriented programming 

    •Object-oriented programming lets you extend a program without having to touch previously tested, working code
    Object-oriented programming provides great flexibility, modularity and reusability through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

​principles of  oops java
Inheritance         
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction

​1.Inheritance
    Deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes acquire all the features of existing classes is called inheritance


2.Polymorphism
Ability to take more than one form
it is used in implementing the inheritance.

3.Encapsulation.
the method and the method  work on data will be combines and that single unit is called as encapsulation and it will helps in secure the data and data hiding.

4.Abstraction
Hiding all the uncessary implementation details and only exposing only the required functionalities
